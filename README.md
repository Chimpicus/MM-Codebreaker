# MM-Codebreaker

My first app design. https://chimpicus.github.io/MM-Codebreaker/

After a break from programming during the pandemic, due to being a kay worker and facing the unprecidented times we have all faced, I'm back with a new learning strategy and a fresh drive in my quest of self development and skill set expansion. This is my first project i have built from the ground up and its not much but I'm proud of my progress so far.

This is a work in progress, a learning tool, and hopefully the first project of many for my portfolio. Feel free to leave any comments and constructive criticism.

The game is based on a puzzle style board game, known as both mastermind and codebreaker. I aim to recreate it with a singleplayer experience with multiple difficulties and a colorblind mode.
