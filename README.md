# MM-Codebreaker

My first app design. https://chimpicus.github.io/MM-Codebreaker/

This is a work in progress, a learning tool, and hopefully the first project of many for my portfolio. Feel free to leave any comments and constructive criticism.

The game is based on a puzzle style board game, known as both mastermind and codebreaker. I aim to recreate it with a singleplayer experience.

This is my first project designed and programmed by myself.
